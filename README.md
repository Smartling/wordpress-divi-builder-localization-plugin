# Divi Builder localization
This plugin was developed in addition to [WordPress Smartling Connector](https://wordpress.org/plugins/smartling-connector/) ([source code](https://github.com/Smartling/wordpress-localization-plugin)). It extends functionality of Smartling Connector by adding localization support for [Divi Builder](https://www.elegantthemes.com/plugins/divi-builder/). In a nutshell it just provides additional configuration how to work with Divi Builder shortcodes:
* Shortcodes should be protected from translator
* Shortcode attributes may contain content or reference to post\category\etc. Smartling translates content and localizes references
* Rest attributes are cloned from an original post into translated
